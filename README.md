Ping-Pong Game Project

Description: This project is a two-player Ping-Pong game developed using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game simulates a classic ping-pong match, with each player controlling a paddle to hit the ball back and forth.

Features:

Two-player support: Player 1 uses the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to move their paddle, while Player 2 uses the 'u' and 'j' keys.

Graphics and Animation: The game features smooth animations and graphics created using the Turtle module.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of each player's score, displaying the current scores at the top of the screen.

Winning Condition: The first player to reach the target score of 20 points wins the game, which is then announced on the screen.

Instructions:

Move Paddles:

Player 1: Use the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to move the right paddle.

Player 2: Use the 'u' key to move the left paddle up and the 'j' key to move it down.

Start the Game: Run the game script to start the match.

Gameplay: Hit the ball with your paddle to send it back to your opponent. Each time your opponent misses the ball, you score a point.

Winning: The game continues until one player reaches the target score of 20 points. The winner is then announced, and the game ends.

How to Run:

Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.

Install the Turtle graphics library if not already installed.

Run the script in a Python environment to start the game.



Conclusion:
This Ping-Pong game project is a fun and interactive way to practice Python programming, specifically using the Turtle graphics library for animations and game development. It provides a hands-on experience in creating game mechanics, handling user input, and implementing a scoring system.
